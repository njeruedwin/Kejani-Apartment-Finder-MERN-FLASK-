Hello My Friends.
Thanks You for viewing my code.

This is a web application created purely with the MERN (MongoDb, expressJs, ReactJs, and NodeJs) stack and the flask framework.
It takes user sentiments about individual apartments and provides analyses of the sentiements about the feautures of the apartment using
 a visually appealing progress bar. (e.g security: -------80% )
This data could both be seen by both the indivual seeking an apartment and owners owning the apartment which enables effective and effecient decision making process for both of them.
To run The Application

1.Type " npm install " inside the root directory to download Server Dependencies.
2.Type " npm install " inside the client directory to Download Front-end Dependencies.

Dont forget to give a star and a follow.
#Ayee
